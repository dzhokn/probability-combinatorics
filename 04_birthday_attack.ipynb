    "## 1. Birthday Attack\n",
    "A birthday attack is a **bruteforce collision** attack that exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory. A birthday attack involves finding **two different inputs** that produce the **same hash** output in a hashing algorithm. This attack leverages the principle of the **birthday paradox** to find these collisions faster than would be expected by random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How Does a Birthday Attack Work?\n",
    "1. **Hash Functions**: In cryptography, hash functions are used to create a fixed-size string (a hash) from variable-size input. Ideally, each unique input should produce a unique hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finding Collisions**: The attack seeks to find two different inputs that result in the **same hash** output. The probability of finding such a collision is much higher than intuitively expected, similar to the birthday paradox.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability Advantage**: For a hash function that produces a hash of n bits, a birthday attack can find a collision in approximately $2^{n/2}$ operations rather than $2^n$ operations, as one might expect with random guessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Implications in Cryptography\n",
    "1. **Digital Signatures**: Birthday attacks can potentially compromise digital signatures by finding two messages with the same hash, one benign and one malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Integrity**: Any cryptographic system relying on hash functions for data integrity might be vulnerable to birthday attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Certificate Authority**: The attack could undermine the trust in certificate authorities if generating two certificates with the same hash is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Implementation\n",
    "### 4.1 Bruteforce\n",
    "The most common way to implement a birthday attack is by utilizing a bruteforce approach (i.e. generate input texts on the fly until a hash collision is found)."

    "A Rainbow Table Attack is a cryptographic attack that uses a precomputed table of hash values to crack passwords. Unlike brute force attacks that generate all possible passwords and compute their hashes on the fly, rainbow tables store a list of precomputed hashes for every possible password. This method significantly **reduces the time** needed to crack a password hash.\n",
